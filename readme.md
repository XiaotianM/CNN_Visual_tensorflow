# CNN Visualization by tensorflow 

here is a my tensorflow Reproduction for Keras《Python深度学习》 chapter 5.4

## Outline:
- Visualizing intermediate activations
- Visualizing convnet filters
- Visualizing heatmaps of class activation

## Files:
 - 5.4-visualizing-what-convnets-learn.ipynb is a copy from https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks

- ResNet50_Layer_Activation_Visual.ipynb is my reproduction for Visualizing intermediate activations

- ResNet50_Kernel_Visual.ipynb is my reproduction for Visualizing convnet filters

- ResNet50_Heatmap.ipynb is my reproduction for Visualizing heatmaps of class activation
